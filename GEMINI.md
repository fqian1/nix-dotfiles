# Dotfiles Project Context

This directory (`~/.dotfiles`) contains my complete NixOS and Home Manager configuration.

The primary configuration files for this project are:
* `flake.nix`: The entry point for the entire system, including inputs and outputs.
* `configuration.nix`: The main NixOS system configuration.
* `home.nix`: The Home Manager configuration for my user.
* `neovim.nix`: Inside /nvim, wraps my neovim config as a package. Not included, since its complete.
